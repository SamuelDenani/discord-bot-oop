# Carro Discord Bot

_Carro is the name of a Discord server that me and my friends use most of the time_

This bot was created using Typescript, Discord.js and Redis for the database.

## Why this project?

Since my friends and I are are almost every day playing or chatting on this Discord server we always have some inside jokes going around and we always play together so I wanted some way to make it easier to consolidate our "culture". As we grow the server we have more and more things going on like more inside jokes, more games to play, more things to talk about. And so I created this bot to help us build this culture and the goal is to make it the core of the server with many jokes, references, tools to help us with management, tools to help us with gaming and general tools like geek news and other.

## The stack I used

The stack, as far as I know, isn't something special in this project, I used Typescript, Discord.js and Redis as database and it's being hosted on Heroku.

## The main reason why I started this project was to learn as many techs as I could while building something useful

Actually, there are only three technologies: Typescript, Redis and Heroku. But the point here is that I learned so much about all this three and many others while establishing the foundation of the project: with Typescript I learned a lot, like **A LOT**, about OO; with Redis I learned that there are many other types of database like LowDB for projects like this and I didn't have to worry about setting a conventional DB like MongoDB or Firebase; and with Heroku I could learn a bit more about how things work outside my localhost and how to actually put project into production. And with the whole project I learned more about files structure, software architecture and new libs.

I believe that at the end of the project I will know much more things and will be capable of building any project I have in mind now all on my own.

## This project isn't done yet

I want to keep growing this bot so I will create more commands, functionalities and all kinds of things my friends want for it. I want it to be the core of our server.

### Final considerations

---

> This project was created using [this repo](https://github.com/markokajzer/discord-soundbot) as reference. Thanks to [Marko Kajzer](https://github.com/markokajzer) for leaving the source code open, I couldn't have started this without project his repo.

---

> All files and folders are in english but since the project is about me and my friends there are some words that do not exist at all (like "Gramaticado") and this are inside jokes. I intend to create some type of definition for this words if it becomes more recurrent.
